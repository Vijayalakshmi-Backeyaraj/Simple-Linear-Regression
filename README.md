# Simple-Linear-Regression

A Linear Regression model is built using both numpy and tensorflow 1.14.
However, the difference is that using tensorflow allows us to reuse the code easily for creating differnet linear models.

# Difference between numpy and tensorflow

Tensorflow is a library for artificial intelligence, especially machine learning. Numpy is a library for doing numerical calculations.
They are often used in combination, because it's often required to pre-process data, which can be done with NumPy, and then do the machine learning on the processed data with Tensorflow.
